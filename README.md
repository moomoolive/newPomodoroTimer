# Pomodoro Timer

A dead-simple and intuitive pomodoro timer web-app.

This app was a sort of experiment on my part, an experiment to create a web-application using only javascript and without the help of any module bundlers (eg. webpack) or transpilers (eg. Babel). All routing, DOM building, animations, etc. are created via javascript. Approach was heavily influenced by React's functional components.

A fair warning for anyone who is going to read through the code, it's pretty messy - as all the javascript was written in one file.

## Credits

App icon was taken from "iconarchive.com" .

A big thank you to Ashfaq Ahmed for his 'CSS Percentage Circle' [blog post](https://codeconvey.com/css-percentage-circle/). It served as the main inspiration for the percentage circle that I use for the "timer" page.

### Notes
* Node is used as for a development server and production minification
* This app is a revamped version of the previous [legacy web-app](https://github.com/moomoolive/pomodoro_timer) && [desktop-app](https://github.com/moomoolive/pomodoro_timer_desktop)
