# Pomodoro Timer

A dead-simple and intuitive pomodoro timer.

This app was a sort of experiment to create a web-application using only javascript, without the help of module bundlers (eg. webpack) or transpilers (eg. Babel). All routing, DOM building, animations, etc. are executed via javascript. My approach to this application was heavily influenced by React's functional components.

A fair warning for anyone who is going to read through the code, it's pretty messy - as all the javascript was written in one file.

## Credits

App icon was taken from "iconarchive.com" .

A big thank you to Ashfaq Ahmed for his 'CSS Percentage Circle' [blog post](https://codeconvey.com/css-percentage-circle/). It served as the main inspiration for the percentage circle that I use for the "timer" page.

### Notes
* Node is used for development server and production minification
* This app is a revamped version of the previous [legacy web-app](https://github.com/moomoolive/pomodoro_timer) && [desktop-app](https://github.com/moomoolive/pomodoro_timer_desktop)
